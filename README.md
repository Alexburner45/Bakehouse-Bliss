# Bakehouse Bliss 
Your HTML code creates a simple, structured restaurant menu webpage titled "BAKEHOUSE BLISS". Here's what it does in detail:

Page Title
The browser tab will show the title "BAKEHOUSE BLISS" because of the <title> tag inside the <head>.

Menu Container
The entire menu content is wrapped inside a <div> with class "menu" (though no CSS is provided, so this is just a container).

Main Heading
Displays the restaurant name "BAKEHOUSE BLISS" as a large heading (<h1>).

Menu Sections
The menu is divided into four sections, each with a heading (<h2>):

APPETIZERS
MAIN COURSES (Top 3)
DESSERTS
DRINKS (Top 3)
Menu Items
Each section lists food items:

Appetizers and Desserts use unordered lists (<ul>).
Main Courses and Drinks use ordered lists (<ol>), implying a ranking or priority.
Food Items Structure
Each food item is a list item (<li>) containing:

The food name inside a <span> with class "food-name".
The price inside a <span> with class "food-price".
A description inside a <div> with class "food-desc".
An image (<img>) showing a picture of the food (except for drinks, which have no images).
Images
The images are loaded from URLs (mostly Google Cloud Storage links). They visually represent each food item.

No Styling
Since there is no CSS in your code, the page will display with default browser styles:

Headings will be bold and sized according to default rules.
Lists will have bullet points or numbers.
Images will appear at their natural size.
The layout will be vertical and simple.
